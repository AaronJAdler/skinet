Pros vs Cons of Typescript

    Pros
-Strong Typing
-Object Oriented
-Better Intellisense
-Access Modifiers (on dev side, Javascript doesnt have access modifiers)
-Future Javascript features (decorators)
-Catches silly mistakes in development
-3rd Party Librarys
-Easy to learn if you know JS (is a superset of JS)

    Cons
-More upfront code (specifying types.. etc)
-Strict mode is... strict! (typings for everything)
