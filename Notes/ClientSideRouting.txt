Routing
    -SPA's need routers
    -Angular router will load a component when route is activated
    -<RouterOutlet> is replaced by the router with what is specified in the route
    -Module architecture of our app encourages lazy loading

Lazy Loading
    In component-routing.module use RouterModule.forChild(routes) *instead of forRoot
    then export RouterModule,
    then in component.module, import ComponentRoutingModule instead of RouterModules

    This causes the code required for a component to be loaded only once the route has been activated.
