IServiceCollection 
    .addTransient()
        Transient lifetime services are created each time they are requested. This lifetime works best for lightweight, stateless services.
        -Instantiated within each method call.

    .addSingleton()
        Singleton lifetime services are created the first time they are requested (or when ConfigureServices is run if you specify an instance there) 
        and then every subsequent request will use the same instance.
        -Until app shuts down.

    .addScoped<Interface, Instance>()
        Scoped lifetime services are created once per request.
