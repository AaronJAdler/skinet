Promises vs Observables

    Promises
-Have one pipeline
-Typically used with async data return
-Not easy to cancel

    Observables
-Are cancellable
-Stream data in multiple pipelines
-Array like operations
-Can be created from other sources like events
-They can be subscribed to

Observables are better for pagination because you can get a continuous subscription stream to receive paginated data.

    HTTP, Observables and RxJS
1. HTTP Get request from ShopService
2. Receive the Observable and cast it into a Products Array
3. Subscribe to the Observable from teh component
4. Assign the Products array to a local variable for use in the components template

    RxJS
-Reactive extensions for Javascript
-Utility library for working with observables, similar to lodash or underscore for javascript objects and arrays.
-Uses the pipe() method to chain RxJS operators together
